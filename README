# LeafNetwork

LeafNetwork is a custom neural network library built from scratch in Python, designed for educational purposes. It provides a simple framework to create, train, and evaluate neural networks using basic layers and activation functions.

## Features

- Dense (fully connected) layers
- Activation functions: ReLU, Tanh, Softmax
- Loss functions: Mean Squared Error (MSE), Categorical Cross Entropy
- Customizable neural network architecture
- Train and evaluate models on the MNIST dataset

## Performance

The LeafNetwork model has been tested on the MNIST dataset provided by TensorFlow (`tf.keras.datasets.mnist`). After training on 40,000 samples for 20 epochs, the model achieved an accuracy of 0.9371.

### Training and Testing

1. **Dataset:** MNIST
2. **Number of Samples:** 40 000
3. **Number of Epochs:** 20
4. **Accuracy:** 0.9371
